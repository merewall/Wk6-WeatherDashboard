# Wk6-WeatherDashboard
Build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser using third-party APIs and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS
## Description
This project was completed after learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web APIs, Third Party APIs, and Server Side APIs. The task was to create a weather dashboard application that retreieves weather data for different cities. The app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. This assignment was meant to add in the use of the newly learned concept of fetch.

The following acceptance criteria were used in the development of this web application:

* When the user opens the application, they are presented with a weather dashboard
* When the user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* When the user views current weather conditions for that city, they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* When the user views the UV index, they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* When the user views future weather conditions for that city, they are pesented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
